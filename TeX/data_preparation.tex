\section{Data Description and Preparation}
\label{sec:data-preparation}

In this project, we have selected the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under the World Health Organization (WHO) dataset\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who}. We considered the data from 2000 to 2015 for 193 countries, in total 2938 rows available for statistical analysis. For each country and year 22 fields are stored. The detailed description of these fileds is presented in table \ref{tab:description}.

Most of the regressors are numerical and can be used in the analysis without modifications. There are a few regressors that are not: Country, year, and status. While year appears numerical, we would argue that it should be treated as a categorical variable. After the data verification, we noticed that there are some missing values in the dataset. We will use various methods to clean the dataset and either impute the missing values or remove some of the regressors or records.
